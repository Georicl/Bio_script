# **SEQTOOLS**
 *Used to facilitate some text message processing work, if you encountered errors please communicate with me!*
## introduction
The tool is designed to be used for a variety of purposes related to sequence processing and supports the reading of logs produced by hisat2 and blast.Subsequent updates are expected on the extraction of the longest transcripts.
## EXTRACT GENES RANDOM
Randomized extraction sequence with seed number 10
## SORT FASTA BY LENGTH
Sort the sequences by length, default is from shortest to longest, you can use reverse
## SHUFFLE
Perform a randomized disruption of the sequence.
## SUB SEQ
Extract the table as provided in sample.txt
## BY ID
use nucle acid as reference
## SEQUENCE STATISTICS
Read the sequences and count the N50, total length, and GC content of the sequences to evaluate the assembly results.
